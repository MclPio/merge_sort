# merge_sort

The goal of this repository is to get some practice on the concept of recursion as a part of The Odin Project curriculum! 

Fibonacci
Two versions made:
1. fibs(n) 
an iterative version to get an array depending
2. fibs_rec(n, array = [0]) 
a recursive version

Merge Sort
1. merge(arr1, arr2)
takes two arrays and merges
2. array_left, array_right
slices array and returns new array
3. merge_sort
the recursive function to merge sort an array
